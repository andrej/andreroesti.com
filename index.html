<h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
<p>Hi! I'm Andr√©, a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://ssllab.org">Secure Systems and Software Lab</a> at the University of California, Irvine. My research interests lie broadly in operating systems and systems security. I am currently working on a novel multi-variant execution environment that incorporates attacker deception techniques.</p>
<p>On this website, you can find a selection of projects I have worked on, as well as some technical notes that might be useful to others.</p>
